## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of problem solutions I've tackled on online judge platforms. The focus is on data structures and algorithms, with an aim to provide well-documented and optimized solutions.

## Languages

The solutions are primarily implemented in C++, but I may include solutions in other languages as well..

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by OJ names. Each problem solution resides in its own directory named after the platform it belongs to.

<!--Here's an overview of the directory structure:

- `Array/`
  - `problem_name/`
    - `solution.[ext]`
    - `README.md`
- `LinkedList/`
  - ...
- `Tree/`
  - ...
- ...
-->
## How to Use

1. Browse the directory corresponding to the platform the problem belongs to.
2. Navigate to the problem name or number from the platform.
3. Find the solution implementation.
